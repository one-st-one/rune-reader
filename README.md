# rune-reader

**Decode, distill, and deliver the essence of your saved articles.**  
**rune-reader** is a Python-based tool that retrieves articles from [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read) (with the flexibility to switch providers later), processes and summarizes them with Large Language Models (LLMs) via frameworks like [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), and forwards the refined insights to your preferred messaging platform.

## Key Features

1. **Flexible Article Source**  
   - **Default:** Fetches articles from the Readwise Reader API.  
   - **Easily Extendable:** Swap in another data source by updating a single configuration file or module.

2. **LLM-Driven Summarization**  
   - **Contextual Insights:** Uses LangChain to produce context-aware, goal-oriented summaries.  
   - **Configurable Styles:** Adjust summary length, depth, and tone to fit your exact needs.

3. **Seamless Delivery**  
   - **Your Messenger of Choice:** Send summaries to Slack, Telegram, Discord, email, or any platform supported by a webhook or API.  
   - **Scheduling & Automation:** Run on a schedule (e.g., via cron or a job scheduler) to keep your content feed always up-to-date and neatly summarized.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **API Credentials:** Obtain a Readwise API token (if using Readwise Reader).
- **LLM Key:** Have an API key for an LLM service (e.g., OpenAI API key) to enable summarization.
- **Messenger Credentials:** Webhook URL or API token for your preferred messaging platform.

## Configuration and Customization

- **Source Client:**  
  Implement a new `fetch_articles()` method in a separate module and update `config.py` to integrate a different article source.
  
- **LLM Settings:**  
  Modify `config.py` or the prompt templates to switch between various models (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 2) or adjust generation parameters.

- **Delivery Channel:**  
  Add a new delivery module for your messenger platform. Update `config.py` to plug it into the workflow.

## Roadmap

- **Enhanced Filtering:**  
  Introduce filters to retrieve only specific tags, authors, or content types from the source.
  
- **Diverse Summary Formats:**  
  Offer multiple summary formats (bullet points, narrative, Q&A) and possibly include sentiment analysis or keyword extraction.

- **Interactive Interface:**  
  Provide a simple CLI or web-based dashboard to manage sources, triggers, and delivery channels.
